					<description><![CDATA[Pipelines often show up as linear disturbances in fields, long after they were created; if it&#039;s just one field, it may be a hedge that was removed, but if it lines up from field to field, it may well be a pipeline.  Here&#039;s the longest one I&#039;ve managed to spot so far: http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/134670223
I had assumed it was for water, as it starts near a reservoir, but I see that since then someone has tagged the complex it probably starts at as being a gas compressor station.
Also, gas pipelines are marked with conspicuous white posts with red bands.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This reminds me of a programme I saw years ago where political comedian had a bizarre and very similar  conversation about the route of Britain&#039;s government oil pipelines. If you&#039;re interested, the section is from 6.35-8.35 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itqMwuB8gOk]]></description>
