					<description><![CDATA[Hi everyone - I am pleased to advise that the official website for Heart of England Way Association has been totally rewritten, and has far more information and news than it once had.  It also has details of the most recent GUIDE to the Way - which now includes circular walks along the way, as well as a guide in BOTH DIRECTIONS.  Take a look at the site and all its information.  Details of how to buy the latest guide can be found at http://www.heartofenglandway.org/the-route/guide-books/]]></description>
