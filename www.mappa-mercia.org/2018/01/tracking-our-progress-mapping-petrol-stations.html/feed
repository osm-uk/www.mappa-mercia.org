Yes, the initial growth is as a result of our Q1 2016 mapping project but the second bit is due to the schools.mapthe.uk tool. The early growth hides a lot of detail as it is total count and there was a big effort to remap nodes to ways and to remove node + way duplicates. There was some tools to track progress but otherwise this was a manual process. As shown the introduction of schools.mapthe.uk greatly sped up the process.

Have you considered applying it to any other dataset?]]></description>
