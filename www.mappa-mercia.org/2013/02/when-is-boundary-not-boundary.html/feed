					<description><![CDATA[If my property title plan &quot;red line&quot; (property built in 1975)runs up to a historical hedge line noted on a OS map 
 dated 1842-1952 and there is also 5Ft RH written, would that indicate that the boundary drawn would be 5Ft from the root of the hedge or in my case an old oak tree that dates 100+ years.

In addition, there is a ditch and the oak tree has grown from the mound on my side of the ditch]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think I have answered my own question.
With thanks to:
http://www.boundary-problems.co.uk/boundary-problems/osmaps.html 
CH = Centre of Hedge
0.91m RH = 0.91m from Root of Hedge
CW = Centre of Wall
FF = Face of Fence
FW = Face of Wall
BB - Base of Bank
TB = Top of Bank
EK = Edge of Kerb
A range of distances from a linnear feature such as a Root of Hedge or Top of Bank may be applied, 0.91 m (3 ft), 1.22m (4 ft) and 1.52 m (5 ft) being the most common.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What is the definition of a Boundary Mereing Symbol as I have been advised by OS that this refers to Council or Parish Council markings on a map for administration purposes but they do not confirm the boundary of a property or field.   Is that correct?]]></description>
