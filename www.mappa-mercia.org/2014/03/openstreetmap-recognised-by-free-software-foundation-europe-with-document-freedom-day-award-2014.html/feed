					<description><![CDATA[It was great to meet with memebers of Free Software Foundation Europe on Saturday. The award is wonderfull recognition of the work that has gine into making OpenStreetMap the best source of free map data. And with OpenStreetMap coming up to it&#039;s tenth year, the timing couldn&#039;t have been any better.

When I first discovered OpenStreetMap.org and saw the map it was clear that it was more up to date than other online maps. Now I realise it&#039;s not just about the map visible on OpenStreetMap.org. Users contribute to the underlying map *data* not just a basic map. By making this map data available for free OpenStreetMap has enabled others to create their own maps, apps and even build businesses using the data. We want to see the map data being used, and this is exactly what Open Standards, Compatibility and Document Freedom is all about.]]></description>
