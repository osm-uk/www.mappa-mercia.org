I think we are within the scope of Notes. We are communicating to mappers - both those that contribute via the map editing software and those &quot;mappers&quot; who have not yet made the leap to edit the actual data but are happy contributing via the Notes system.

Let&#039;s do trials and see what the impact is. We just need to keep an eye on the number of notes and the open:close ratio:

					<description><![CDATA[One thing to watch out for with this idea, is that Notes feature &quot;is intended for humans to communicate with other humans (mappers). It is not a place to dump automated error checking.&quot;  We have lots of &quot;quality assurance&quot; tests, which tend to get presented on separate websites. We don&#039;t want to start duplicating these as notes on a large scale.

I think there&#039;s an argument to be made that certain QA tests, such as the OS Locator comparisons, are of a much higher importance than others, so they might deserve to be &quot;promoted&quot; as notes, but this might be a slippery slope.

If the notes are still only ever created by humans, then this is less likely to be a problem. This way we might try it in a test area (as you&#039;ve suggested) and also create notes first in areas where it&#039;s higher priority, or where it seems more likely to work.

I love the &quot;quarterly project&quot; idea by the way. Must try to join in some more.]]></description>
