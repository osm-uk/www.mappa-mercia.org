					<description><![CDATA[Delighted that the Townland mapping project has given you folks inspiration.  

You&#039;ve chosen a good SMART (specific, measureable, achieveable, realistic and time based) objective to start with and one that will benefit the map greatly. I look forward to seeing how you get on with your own project.

I also love the idea of the 3 monthly cycle. Its long enough to achieve real gains but not so long as to seem never ending and boring. Added to that, it gives a nice period for updates if you so chose i.e. one at the start, 2 in the middle and one at the end when you announce the next one. Its a good motivator and for those that love stats (me) its a good way to measure the impact of focusing a community on a particular topic. 

Happy mapping!]]></description>
