I wondered how long it would take for someone to pick up on that sentence! You&#039;re right it&#039;s not &quot;simple&quot;, which is one reason why http://switch2osm.org/ was established. We still have some way to go but it&#039;s not right to hold changes back because other areas aren&#039;t 100% perfect (especially when we have a tile usage policy anyway).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mappa-mercia.org/2015/01/change-how-mature-is-openstreetmap.html#comment-370&quot;&gt;Q&lt;/a&gt;.

@Q The lower population density of the US is often used as an excuse, but in that location (just north of NYC) it surely isn&#039;t a valid one.  US mappers, as a whole, don&#039;t seem to be as keen to &quot;get out and map stuff&quot; as some other places around the world.  Obviously that&#039;s a gross generalisation, but there&#039;s some truth in it.  People have speculated that it&#039;s in part due to the old TIGER import of some spectacularly inaccurate data; I&#039;m not especially convinced by that.

On the &quot;tools&quot; question, &quot;simple&quot; reversions through JOSM usually work without conflicts if done quickly, and even if conflicts occur it&#039;s not _that_ difficult to resolve them - the problems usually occur if no-one notices a problem for months.  When that fails, there are still options - raising it on IRC or even asking a help question (where there are copywrite issues the extra redaction tools that the DWG have may be needed; but even that&#039;s only an email away).

What we really need to finally resolve problems like the stray node that you spotted is not &quot;better tools&quot; but &quot;more surveying mappers&quot; - currently apart from the rogue shop Washingtonville has two schools but no other POIs at all.  NYC&#039;s not a mapper-free area either - &quot;neis-one&quot; shows 7 new mappers in the last week within what I&#039;d consider a travellable distance of Washingtonville.

The big OSM-US conference is in NYC this summer - one really great legacy that could leave would getting people surveying their local areas.]]></description>

@someoneelse

Yes, I think that has to do with the lower population density of the US. More eyes would be helpful, but it would also be helpful to be able to fully redact changes once an editor is known to be malicious. Even a manual clean-up is not entirely effective as there are still things that are missed after several eyes and rounds of editing. See https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/707487406

Attempts at using reversion tools failed, likely because of interaction with relations. It&#039;s a big vulnerability when users can just vandalize whatever they feel like and we have to resort to fixing things by hand. As the data quality and density grows, protecting the validity of that data will become more important and more difficult.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Couple of interesting issues here.

Not everything that helps OSM is software development. In fact, I&#039;d go further - core osm.org development, operations and maintenance are the aspect of our project that&#039;s in the best health at the moment. There&#039;s always room for improvement but it&#039;s not where I&#039;d choose to focus energies.

An example. I&#039;ve probably done two things that have made a big difference to OSM: Potlatch and switch2osm. The former was development, the latter wasn&#039;t - it was me with my publishing hat on rather than my coding hat; I had no input into the technical content of the guides (indeed, I&#039;d never set up a rendering server when we launched the site).

There are lots of content and marketing opportunities like switch2osm - indeed, we&#039;d identified and were progressing one before CWG imploded. That sort of work is real, helpful progress for OSM, so much more valuable than endless hand-wringing discussion on mailing lists.

And yes, there are software development needs too (I might have mentioned a mobile app one or a thousand times...) but by and large these are away from core osm.org itself.

Second point.

If you think software development &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the way to go, forget about OSMF organising it, at least for the moment. OSMF isn&#039;t capable of running a whelk stall right now, let alone employing developers. I hope the new board will fix that (though, to be honest, the rejection of term limits has dashed much of the hopes I had in them) but we would be very foolish, given recent history, to expect advances in OSM to come from OSMF.

Fortunately this isn&#039;t actually an issue. Development can and does happen outside OSMF. iD is a terrific model: a big improvement to OSM that was externally funded but developed in consultation with the community, yet at enough of a distance that the bikeshedders couldn&#039;t get their claws into it. It&#039;s actually not that far from how most open source projects are developed - supportive companies pay for people (or parts of people) to work on the project. (WMF is an exception, but Mediawiki isn&#039;t exactly something we want to emulate anyway...)

One interesting avenue that I&#039;d be keen to explore is for some of the smaller, independent developers (independent consultants, or SMEs like Geofabrik) to form a consortium that could obtain such funding.

And a postscript:

Comment comes with responsibility too. In a volunteer-driven community, making your opinion known forcefully or repeatedly, without the willingness to back it up with actions, can have a disheartening effect on those who &#039;do&#039;. That&#039;s what drove me out of OSMF in the CWG episode, and I&#039;m afraid it looks like it might be happening again over in the Membership Services Working Group - excessive bikeshedding towards people who are actually putting the hours in. We need to think about methods of community interaction so that such voices are not given a prominence they don&#039;t deserve. (To clarify, I&#039;m not directing this observation at this posting or its comment thread!)]]></description>

I sent that to the talk-us list rather than just remotely fixing it because I thought that there (just outside NYC itself) there would be people able to confirm on the ground what the story was.  Unfortunately that didn&#039;t happen, and the area has now been tidied up (by a London-based mapper - thanks Harry!).

When &quot;odd&quot; data appears in the UK or Ireland (and lots of other places) someone spots it pretty soon, gets in touch with a local mapper and it gets tidied fairly quickly, like with https://twitter.com/czajkowski/status/519846771267497984 .  This doesn&#039;t seem to be happening with the US, and I don&#039;t think that it&#039;s a &quot;tools&quot; problem so much as a &quot;people&quot; one.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Thing is, death metal is so much better than soppy balladry.&quot;

I actually lol&#039;ed picturing you in the local church banging out a bit of Cannibal Corpse on the organ. 

As for change, yes, it comes in many forms and I&#039;m working on many of them presently (OSM Ireland, #MapLesotho, OSM classes &#038; lectures in local schools &#038; colleges, member of 3(2) working groups, creating videos and other training guides etc) however nothing I am working on involves software development simply because I&#039;m not a software developer. 

This is a big problem in OSM, like so many things, there are good ideas and suggestions falling between the cracks because too much relies on too small a group. 

Looking at a recent HOT example, they hired someone for a specific period to only work on improvements to (a) the HOT site and (b) the tasking manager interface. Maybe this is something that should be done from time to time in OSM. Bite the bullet, and spend some cash]]></description>

I agree, we&#039;re not short on ideas. I have ideas all the time but unfortunately a working prototype is generally beyond me. At best I could do some wireframes or visualisations but this doesn&#039;t get you much further than words.

So how do we turn ideas into reality? I see 2 options:

1. We go on a major offensive to attract new developers to OpenStreetMap which means we have to get out there with a strong positive message and internally we have to squash the negativity in some of our mailing lists so as to not put developers off.

2. We develop the OSMF (or for that matter any group that is able to fundraise) in to a central coordinator that is able to filter the ideas and progress the best by throwing resources and money at them.

I&#039;d love to hear if you have any other ideas.

(p.s. Fred&#039;s idea of being able to &quot;subscribe&quot; to change notifications filtered by topic seems like a good solution for managing change as OSM matures:

https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/talk/2015-January/071761.html

Would you like me to create some wireframes visualising this? )]]></description>

<p>(p.s. Fred&#8217;s idea of being able to &#8220;subscribe&#8221; to change notifications filtered by topic seems like a good solution for managing change as OSM matures:</p>

<p>Would you like me to create some wireframes visualising this? )</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s not targeted at anyone in particular, nor was I asking for justification!

For both of the examples you cite, we have plenty of ideas circulating on the lists. It would be a bit facile of me to say that ideas on the lists - or on blogs, or on Twitter, or wherever - don&#039;t make things change. In theory they could &lt;i&gt;lead&lt;/i&gt; to change.

But in OSM they very, very rarely do. That&#039;s not particularly a failing of OSM, it&#039;s just how our community has evolved. What works is putting a prototype out there (whether that&#039;s software or something else) and attracting people to your cause.

In both the above cases, there&#039;s a prototype just screaming to get out - and neither is software development per se. openstreetmap-carto right now is caught between serving the &quot;old Mapnik&quot; and &quot;old Osmarender&quot; markets. Some people want it to be a lovely-looking showcase style, others want a comprehensive mapper-focused style: you only need to look at the issue queue to see that. It&#039;s not a tension that can be trivially reconciled. Could a New Osmarender work - rendered with Mapnik, naturally, but aiming for completeness in a way that a general-purpose render will never do? Prototype it and find out.

Same goes for the tagging question. You or I can spend 300 words here discussing a solution (it&#039;ll probably be documentation) but it doesn&#039;t achieve anything, and nor will it lead to anything being achieved. Better to spend that time quickly knocking up a prototype. If it works and people join in - great. If not, that&#039;s lessons learned for next time.

Let&#039;s make &quot;more prototyping, less wibbling&quot; a challenge for OSM in 2015.]]></description>
