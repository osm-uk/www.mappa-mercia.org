					<description><![CDATA[I am told that there have been many finger posts at this position in Pelsall with the original in a museum nearby. The current occupant, which I restored a few years ago, is a bit of a hybrid as it comprises a post from the old Birmingham tramways onto which a lamp was fitted together with the four large cast resin hands to point out the directions. Whilst undertaking the restoration a local lady told me that her father&#039;s hand had been used as the model for the castings. The pattern must have been scaled up however as these hands are twice the size if my own.]]></description>
