					<description><![CDATA[It makes more sense when you know that it was actually built as a water pumping station. These could be very elaborate indeed, both externally and internally - water supply was a source of great municipal pride as well as being a major contribution to public health. If you think this is elaborate, the same architects, Martin and Chamberlain, built a vast example in Venetian Gothic at Whitacre, near Shustoke, Warwickshire (still in use by Severn Trent), which has been compared to one of their board schools.]]></description>

I use listed_status=Grade II, Grade I or Grade II* and in the source tag where I got the info from- usually  a local authority list but sometimes from English Heritage. If it&#039;s also designated as a heritage building ( e.g UNESCO or a Civic Society or Local Authority Tourist Trail I also use heritage= x following the wiki tagging guidelines. I should probably write a wiki page!]]></description>
