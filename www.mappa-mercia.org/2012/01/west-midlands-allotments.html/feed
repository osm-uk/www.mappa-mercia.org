					<description><![CDATA[Interesting, thanks. It would be good to link up with the Allotment Data people, I did contact them via Twitter a while ago about some of my efforts in London but never pursued it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allotment data in London is very inconsistent, out of date, and not readily available. We also have a large and growing network of less formal food growing spaces through a programme called Capital Growth. I wrote a bit about this work here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://data.london.gov.uk/blog/can-crowdsourcing-improve-open-data&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also see this wiki page:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/London/Datastore_allotments]]></description>
