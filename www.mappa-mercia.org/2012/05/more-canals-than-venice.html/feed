Yes, I live in Cape Coral and we have over 400 miles of canals, 3 times what Venice has. You can live anywhere in the country’s 2nd largest city by size, and be within 10 walking minutes of any canal. Both fresh and saltwater.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[No one should refer to the fact they live &quot;in&quot; Cape Coral - it is an actual cape and Cape Codders would never say Iive in Cape Cod. The Correct way to refer to  say it is I live &quot;ON&quot; Cape Coral

It is 120 miles south of Tampa on the Gulf lf Mexico]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Narrow boats pass each other &#039;left to left&#039; (the opposite of driving on the oad in England. The island is sufficiently far enough away from all the banks to allow two boats to pass each other with ease - so there is no &#039;rule of the road&#039; about which side of the island to pass. Depending on where they are coming from and where they are going to the narrowboat steerer would chose the eaiest/shortest side to pass.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think it is a roundabout in the sense of a roundabout on a road where there are strict rules which way you go round it. You would go round whichever way was easiest, avoiding sharp turns (which are difficult in a long narrowboat).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another option for enjoying Birmingham&#039;s canals is to hire a narrowboat for a holiday. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers&lt;br /&gt;Paul The Archivist]]></description>
