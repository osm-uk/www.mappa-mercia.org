					<description><![CDATA[aseerel4c26 has sent you a message through OpenStreetMap:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to comment at http://blog.mappa-mercia.org/2012/12/mapping-transverse-steps.html but it seems to require some third-party accounts to do so... as I had already typed the text.. here it is (you may publish it there if you want to):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real-world feature is quite clearly an area. If we would tag this area highway=steps how to indicate the direction - that is the only problem. I would make it an area highway=steps but overlay (sharing nodes with the area) some highway=steps ways (one-dimensional) at important points with an indication of direction (incline=up/down). That could be a cheap way to indicate the direction for the whole area but at least it leads to routing compatibility.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d make a new tag barrier=steps. It could be applied to a node (very short steps on a path), a way (for short steps over a wide lenghth, or long steps over a path), or an area (for long, wide steps, like the example given here).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highway=steps implies barrier=steps, so this doesn&#039;t have to be combined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would suffice for routing, and be useful for rendering as it can be combined with several highway types (path, pedestrian, footway)&lt;br /&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[I discussed this with Peter (not sherbourne, a different Peter), here in Coventry. We ended up going for steps at each end and a zig zag path between:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=52.407747&amp;mlon=-1.505586&amp;zoom=18&amp;layers=M&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=52.409599&amp;mlon=-1.508375&amp;zoom=18&amp;layers=M&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a wide area of steps but no zig zag path, we decided to use a few step ways spaced evenly along the area:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=52.407714&amp;mlon=-1.506358&amp;zoom=18&amp;layers=M&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of the are ideal, but they work for now.]]></description>
