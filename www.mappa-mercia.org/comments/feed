It appears things have moved on since the original discussion and this site https://dataservices.riscauthority.co.uk/map/index shows the location of 1000s of fire hydrants. Surely there must be a way of connecting this data to OSM.

					<description><![CDATA[If my property title plan &quot;red line&quot; (property built in 1975)runs up to a historical hedge line noted on a OS map 
 dated 1842-1952 and there is also 5Ft RH written, would that indicate that the boundary drawn would be 5Ft from the root of the hedge or in my case an old oak tree that dates 100+ years.

In addition, there is a ditch and the oak tree has grown from the mound on my side of the ditch]]></description>
