It appears things have moved on since the original discussion and this site https://dataservices.riscauthority.co.uk/map/index shows the location of 1000s of fire hydrants. Surely there must be a way of connecting this data to OSM.

&quot;Why on Earth are you trying to expose this information after the potential for malicious attack has been explained to you!?&quot;

Because the locations of most if not all hydrants are not secret - as you can see above, many are marked with luridly-visible, bright yellow signs.

Asking for the location of hydrants doesn&#039;t imply the revealing of secret or secure information, it just saves leg work and volunteer time, and enables us to be more thorough.

Not being 6, we were able to work this out for ourselves. Why couldn&#039;t you?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know of two occasions where the Fire Brigade were unable to find hydrants near to a fire. In the first in Devon people died in a hotel fire possibly exaserbate by the inability to find the nearest Hydrant or get sufficient water when it was located. In the second occasion it was on a large private premise and the fire hydrants were in an unusual location in the wall of a building and were apparently not shown on the fire brigade plans.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The arguments for not disclosing information seem pretty reasonable to me. Why on Earth are you trying to expose this information after the potential for malicious attack has been explained to you!? Why do your needs come above Nation security? Are you 6?]]></description>

Watch this old school programme Stop Look and Listen (link below) on the fire service and you will hear that the old pre-metric fire hydrant signs told you the number of paces to the fire hydrant nearby, https://youtu.be/A1An0YYlY7k]]></description>
