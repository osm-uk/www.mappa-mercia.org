Chris, this isn&#039;t intended as demoralising - I&#039;m sorry you feel that way. As we&#039;ve said many times, the quarterly projects are supposed to be a bit of fun nothing else. This is the fifth and is by far our most popular. The emails, twitter and blog posts are just a way to celebrate this and try to keep momentum for those who want to get involved. The fact that Hull and the East Riding of Yorkshire ranked so highly on day 1 (Robert W&#039;s tool only shows the current status but you were right up there on Jan 1st), is something you should be proud of. If you want to put a few words together about your experience mapping schools prior to the project I will happily post it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I find this somewhat demoralising. I added, over the past 9 years, almost every school in Hull and the East Riding of Yorkshire, including their outlines. Some I named the buildings not the outline (there were no guidelines then). There have been a few modifications in the past few weeks by other people, but none of the existing work get recognised in these lists. It&#039;s as if all the work towards schools by the people before this project just gets brushed aside. Am I alone in feeling this armchair project is a triumph of hype over real progress?]]></description>
